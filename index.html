        <div class="about">
            <p>I am a junior software engineer with a First Class degree in Electronic Engineering, drawn to the mix of
                logic, creativity, and problem-solving that software development offers. My interest in software grew
                through university projects and was solidified during General Assembly’s Software Engineering Bootcamp,
                where I built multiple full-stack JavaScript applications and learned how to take ideas from concept to
                working product. What matters most to me is building software that feels thoughtful, with code that is
                clear and reliable, and designed with real users in mind. I enjoy collaborating with others, learning from
                feedback and refining the details that make a product robust and maintainable. I am now seeking a junior
                software engineer or developer role where I can keep growing, contribute meaningfully to a team, and
                work on products that solve real problems.</p>

            <h2>Engineering Dissertation Project</h2>

            <p class="interests">
                This project sits at the intersection of engineering and software development. It began as my
                electronic engineering dissertation, where I built a software application to analyse cardiac responses
                to music
                using real physiological data. The project combined signal processing, data analysis and a graphical
                user interface.
                It played a key role in shaping my interest in software, in that software is a way to turn complex technical concepts
                into accessible,
                interactive tools. I am currently revisiting the project to improve the interface and develop it further
                into a more
                polished, user-focused application.
            </p>

            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p class="interests">My interest in music continues beyond my engineering work and is what originally drew
                me to explore it as part of my dissertation project. I have always been curious about how music can
                influence and interact with people, and it is that same curiosity that made music a natural and stimulating focus for my
                project.
                Outside of technology, I really enjoy cooking and experimenting with new recipes, as well as pilates and fitness.
